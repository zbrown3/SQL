-- AS is a keyword in SQL that allows you to rename a column or table using alias.  The new name can be anything you want as long as you put it inside of single quotes.
-- It's best practice to surround your aliases with single quotes.
-- When using AS, the columns are not being renamed in the table.  The aliases only appear in the result.
